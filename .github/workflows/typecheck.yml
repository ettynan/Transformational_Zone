# This workflow runs TypeScript type checking on every push to main
# and on every pull request.
#
# Purpose:
# - Ensure the codebase has no TypeScript type errors
# - Catch issues early before merging
# - Does NOT emit files or affect runtime behavior

name: TypeScript Type Check

# Triggers:
# - Any pull request
# - Any push to the main branch
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  typecheck:
    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js with npm caching for faster installs
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm

      # Step 3: Install dependencies exactly as defined in package-lock.json
      - run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run TypeScript in type-checking mode only
      # This uses "tsc --noEmit" via the npm script
      - run: npm run typecheck
